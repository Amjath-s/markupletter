          <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
          <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: </p>
          Polynesian chicken dance
          <blockquote>
            A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating as far as 300 <abbr title="Before christ" >BC</abbr> a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
          </blockquote>
          Icelandic brownian shuffle 
          <blockquote>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a meadn of getting warm,they used to practice this dance,which involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thoughy this dance inspird modern styles such as Tweking.
          </blockquote>
          Arctic robot dance
          <blockquote>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by <em>"robotic", </em> stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
          </blockquote>
